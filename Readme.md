Broker Sync – Scalable Trade Integration Layer
Broker Sync is a modular backend system designed for syncing trade data from third-party brokers into a unified format, with an accompanying minimal frontend for quick testing.

Key Features

Pluggable Broker Adapters – Easily add new brokers (e.g., Zerodha, Alpaca, MetaTrader).
Trade Data Normalization – Consistent format across multiple broker APIs.
Token Management – Simulated expiry & refresh flow (can be upgraded to OAuth 2.0).
REST API (Express.js) – Clean and modular with service-oriented structure.
Frontend (HTML/CSS/JS) – For quick trade visualization & manual entry.
Dockerized Setup – One-command local deployment with PostgreSQL support.

For Startups –

Extensibility: Broker adapters are isolated in /adapters for easy onboarding of new APIs.
Low Setup Overhead: Works locally with Docker & PostgreSQL – no complex infra needed initially.
Speed to Market: Minimal frontend for demos, investor presentations, or internal testing.
Upgrade Path: Token handling can move to OAuth, caching with Redis, and async job queues for scale.

Potential Improvements -

Authentication & Authorization
Implement JWT-based auth for user security.
Role-based access control for API endpoints.
Database Layer Enhancements
Use Prisma or Sequelize for schema management & migrations.
Support multi-tenant database design for multiple customers.
Scalable Sync Execution
Move trade fetching to background jobs (BullMQ / RabbitMQ).
Add retry & backoff strategies for API rate limits.


Frontend Upgrade
Move to React.js or Next.js for a production-grade UI.

Add charts (Recharts / Chart.js) for trade insights.
